Test Cases for Rivest Sampling Algorithm
========================================

The purpose of this repository is to provide test cases for a
pseudo-random sampling algorithm described by [Ronald L. Rivest][rivest].
The algorithm is especially suitable for things like selecting precincts
at random for an election audit.

The [reference implementation][ref-impl] of the algorithm
(written in Python), along with a description of the algorithm,
can be found on Rivest's web site.  [Philip B. Stark][stark]
also has an online [browser implementation][browser-impl] on his web site.
